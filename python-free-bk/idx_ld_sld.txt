This lot is among the few remaining in the sought-after Seacoast Shores Association, offering a prime location halfway between the downtown Falmouth restaurants and the shopping hub of Mashpee Commons. There is already a foundation for a 3-bedroom, 1-bathroom Cape-style home. With the proper permits, you can bring to life the lovely home you've always envisioned, just a short walk away from a convenient neighborhood boat ramp and only 0.4 miles from the private association beach.You have the option of a non-mandatory $300 annual HOA fee allowing the use of the association beach and the multiple boat ramps or an upgraded membership with a $8,000 initiation charge and a tiered annual fee (see attached Summary of Benefits and Fees for details) to enjoy all the amenities this community offers, from the Clubhouse to the tennis courts, and the outdoor swimming pool. This is your opportunity to make a wise investment you will not regret."|16|11/15/2023 8:22:00 AM|0|"N"|"CN250745"|"AN1150"|320000|9/20/2024||"Barnstable"|"MA"|"A"|8712|0.2|"A,C"|"D"|"A"|"N"||"N"|||"E"|"N"

Very close to the Lakeside Beach and boat ramp, both public. Water and sewer are public and gate boxes are in place on the lot.  There is an opening in the stone wall already in place for a driveway. Excellent access to the highway, concerts at Indian Ranch and  many fine restaurants and shopping close by. Survey and site plan are attached to this listing.  Great spot to build your dream home!"|2|6/7/2025 3:01:00 PM|0|"N"|"NB111886"|"NB3115"|85000|7/2/2025||"Worcester"|"MA"|"A"|46174|1.06|"A,C"|"I"|"A"|"N"||"N"||"N"|"C"|"N"
